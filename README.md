# Chocolate-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project
# üç´ Chocolate Sales ETL Pipeline

This project demonstrates a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** process using Python to analyze chocolate sales data. Built as part of my data engineering training, it highlights practical skills in data ingestion, transformation, and preparation for reporting or visualization.

## üìå Project Summary

- **Objective:** Automate the process of cleaning and preparing chocolate sales data for business insights.
- **Tools & Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
- **ETL Focus Areas:**
  - Data ingestion from raw sources (e.g., CSV)
  - Data transformation (cleaning, deriving metrics, aggregations)
  - Exporting processed data for further analysis

## üöÄ ETL Workflow Breakdown

### 1. Extract
- Load raw chocolate sales data from a CSV file.
- Inspect the dataset structure using `.head()`, `.info()`, and `.describe()`.

### 2. Transform
- **Cleaning:** Remove null values, standardize column formats (dates, strings).
- **Derivation:** Create new columns such as `Total Sales = Units Sold * Unit Price`.
- **Grouping:** Analyze data by product category, region, and date.
- **Validation:** Check for outliers or anomalies and ensure data consistency.

### 3. Load
- Export the cleaned and transformed dataset into a new CSV file for reporting.
- Optional integration into Power BI or SQL-based reporting platforms.
